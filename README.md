# QMK - Now Playing ðŸŽµ
This repo contains terrible code that produces cool functionality on QMK keyboards with OLED screens. It serves as a demonstration of the [qmk-oled-api repository](https://github.com/dob9601/qmk-oled-api)

## Installation

Currently no packaging has been setup. Run the project via `cargo run` after setting the path to your device (`/dev/hidrawX` where `X` is some number). You will need to configure your keyboard as a `qmk-oled-api` client. An example of how to do so can be found in the README of the [qmk-oled-api repository](https://github.com/dob9601/qmk-oled-api#client-snippet)
