This project allows for information about the currently playing song to be shown on a QMK keyboard's OLED display.

It is currently untested on Windows but is unlikely to work due to dependence on MPRIS2-compatible media players. Pull Requests are welcome to extend support though

The code in this repo is currently in a pretty hacky state as it serves as a demonstration of the capabilities of the [qmk-oled-api repository](https://github.com/dob9601/qmk-oled-api).

## Installation

Currently no packaging has been setup. Run the project via `cargo run` after setting the path to your device (`/dev/hidrawX` where `X` is some number). You will need to configure your keyboard as a `qmk-oled-api` client. An example of how to do so can be found in the README of the [qmk-oled-api repository](https://github.com/dob9601/qmk-oled-api#client-snippet)

pre-built binaries are [available in releases](https://github.com/dob9601/qmk-nowplaying/releases/latest)
